## Setting Up and Installing SFRA

The SFRA (Storefront Reference Architecture) reference application provides two sample sites:

- RefArch
- RefArchGlobal

SFRA also provides associated data and code to drive the sample ecommerce storefront.

The SFRA reference application represents Commerce Cloud's current recommended approach for implementing digital storefronts. If you're creating a site, use the SFRA reference application as a starting point.

To get started with SFRA, you have to perform some preliminary steps:

- [Obtain a GitHub account if you don't already have one](https://documentation.b2c.commercecloud.salesforce.com/DOC1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.demandware.dochelp%2FSFRA%2FSFRASetup.html)
- [Build SFRA and push the code to the server](https://documentation.b2c.commercecloud.salesforce.com/DOC1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.demandware.dochelp%2FSFRA%2FBuildingSFRA.html)
- [Uploading Code for SFRA](https://documentation.b2c.commercecloud.salesforce.com/DOC1/index.jsp?topic=/com.demandware.dochelp/SFRA/ConfiguringSFRA.html)
- [Configure SFRA for your instance so that you can see products and catalogs on the sample storefront](https://documentation.b2c.commercecloud.salesforce.com/DOC1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.demandware.dochelp%2FSFRA%2FConfiguringSFRA.html)


After your environment is set up, you can run the SFRA reference application and explore how it is constructed.
